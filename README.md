# opencore-ryzen-3200G
This is my EFI configuration for a 3200G desktop build. NOTE: I'm using the Vega iGPU

NOTE:
1) Generate your serial numbers from GenSMBIOS project!
2) For bluetooth, config.plist is already configured to support non native cards but the kexts arent uploaded in the kexts directory. Download them from https://github.com/acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM/releases and move the kexts to EFI/OC/Kexts directory in your USB

My BUILD:

1. AMD Ryzen 3 3200G
2. ASUS EX-A320M GAMING Motherboard
3. Network Card: RealTek Semiconductor RTL8168/8111 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet NIC
4. Audio Codec: RealTek ALC887
5. PS/2 Keyboard
